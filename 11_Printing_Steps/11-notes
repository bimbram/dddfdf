039 - More on Steps
->Create an iterative solution first before create a recursive solution if possible
->Writing the recursive solution 


038 - Step Up Your Steps Game
->Looking at recursive solution
->Recursive always need base case to stop a recursion
->It's better to start from the base case
->Change the argument when calling our own function (recursion)

Recursion tips
1. Figure out the bare  minimum pieces of information to represent your problem
2. Give reasonable defaults to the bare minimum pieces of info
3. Check the base case. Is there any work left to do? if not, return
4. Do some work. Call your function again, making sure the arguments have changed in some fashion
